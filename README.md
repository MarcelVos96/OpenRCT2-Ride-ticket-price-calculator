# Ride ticket price calculator for OpenRCT2

This plugin allows you to calculate the maximum ticket price of any ride, either one in your park or one that's made up.

## Current features
- Select a ride in your park with either the dropdown meny or the ride picker.
- The current maximum ticket price will be highlighted in silver.
- Automatic updates when any of the variables relating to the currently selected ride change.
- Make up your own input to theorize the prices of any ride type with any stats.

## Installation

1. This plugin requires at least OpenRCT2 version v0.4.21.
2. Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases page](https://github.com/tygrysek90/OpenRCT2-Ride-ticket-price-calculator/releases).
3. To install it, put the downloaded `*.js` file into your `/OpenRCT2/plugin` folder.
    - Easiest way to find the OpenRCT2-folder is by launching the OpenRCT2 game, click and hold on the red toolbox in the main menu, and select "Open custom content folder".
    - Otherwise this folder is commonly found in `C:/Users/<YOUR NAME>/Documents/OpenRCT2/plugin` on Windows.
    - If you already had this plugin installed before, you can safely overwrite the old file.
4. Once the file is there, it should show up ingame in the dropdown menu under the map icon.
